// Repo-doc PR delivery (#3000/#3004, part of the repo-doc generation roadmap #2993). Turns a rendered AGENTS.md

// request against the target repo -- branch + commit + PR-open, reusing the SAME installation-token write

// DIFF-AWARE REFRESH (#3004): before building anything, the CURRENT AGENTS.md on the default branch (if any) is
// fetched and run through src/review/generated-doc-refresh.ts's marker-block refresh. That call is the single
// source of truth for what happens next -- a first-run repo gets the full generated content, a repo whose
// generated section is unchanged gets NO pull request at all (no-op), a repo whose generated section changed
// gets a pull request with everything outside the markers preserved byte-for-byte, and a repo whose marker
// block is missing or malformed gets neither a silent overwrite nor a guess -- just a reported reason.

## What this is

\`AGENTS.md\`, generated from a profile of ${repoFullName}'s own code -- its indexed file layout, naming and test-file conventions, build/test/lint commands, and contribution-workflow settings (whether CI publishes a required check, the linked-issue policy, and indexed CI workflow files). \`CLAUDE.md\` is kept in sync with it (as a symlink where the platform supports one, otherwise an identical copy), so the two never drift apart.

## Why it looks like this

Every fact above was read directly from this repository, not templated or guessed. If something looks wrong, it most likely means the underlying signal doesn't represent this repo well -- edit the generated file directly on this branch (or after merging) rather than filing an issue against Gittensory.

## Opting out

Disable repo-doc generation for this repository, or simply close this pull request -- no further action is taken until it is re-enabled.
