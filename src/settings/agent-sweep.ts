// The scheduled re-gate sweep (#777) recomputes the gate verdict for OPEN PRs that no webhook is refreshing —

// duplicate merges, the focus manifest or settings change). These pure helpers decide WHICH PRs a sweep
// recomputes so the processor stays a thin orchestration shell.

// open queue cannot blow the queue-message budget. The stalest are picked first.

// re-evaluated within minutes so it MERGES once its approval registers (BLOCKED→CLEAN). One hour stranded
// approved PRs unmerged for up to an hour.

/**
 * Select the open PRs a single repo sweep should recompute: drop drafts and anything a webhook touched within
 * `freshnessWindowMs` of `now` (don't race an in-flight review), then take the `max` PRs the sweep has gone
 * longest WITHOUT re-gating — ordered by `lastRegatedAt` ascending, NOT GitHub's `updatedAt`.
 *
 * Why two different timestamps (#audit-sweep-converge): the review WRITE that bumps GitHub's `updatedAt` is
 * SUPPRESSED under dry-run / pause, so ordering the sweep by `updatedAt` pins the stalest PRs forever and it
 * never advances. The sweep instead stamps its own `lastRegatedAt` marker on every pass (a D1 write, never
 * suppressed), so a just-regated PR sorts freshest and the next pass covers the next-stalest — full coverage of
 * all open PRs in ceil(open/max) sweeps. GitHub's `updatedAt` is used ONLY for the freshness skip (a PR a
 * webhook is actively gating), never for the sort. Pure + deterministic: same inputs → same ordered batch.

 * runs — so the MOST RECENT stamp across the repo's open PRs (`latestRegatedAt`) being within `windowMs` of `now`
 * means a sweep is actively working through its queue. The cron re-arms every ~2 min, far faster than a sweep
