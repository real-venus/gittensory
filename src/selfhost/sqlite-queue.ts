   *  reset timestamp for up to its full original delay (observed up to ~15m) even when a fresher, healthier
   *  observation arrived moments after it was deferred; the condition check recovers it on the NEXT sweep tick
   *  instead (bounded by FOREGROUND_LIVENESS_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS, default 60s) whenever the underlying rate-limit
   *  pressure has actually cleared, regardless of job age. When more jobs are eligible than maxReleasePerSweep
   *  allows, selectForegroundDeferralsToRelease picks the oldest first -- a large inherited backlog drains
   *  gradually over several sweep ticks instead of flooding GitHub with every re-attempt at once. Logs +
   *  records a metric ONCE per sweep (aggregate count), not per row, so a large release batch cannot spam the
   *  log.
   *
   *  Candidate selection queries an OLDEST window AND a NEWEST window (#selfhost-queue-liveness clear-bucket
   *  starvation fix), not just one oldest-first window. A single `ORDER BY created_at ASC LIMIT` window can be
   *  filled ENTIRELY by older still-rate-limited jobs once the backlog exceeds the limit -- selectForegroundDeferralsToRelease's
   *  clear-bucket-priority sort can only prioritize candidates it is actually shown, so a large-enough glut of
   *  older blocked jobs would permanently hide every newer, already-admittable candidate from it, defeating the
   *  whole point of the clear-bucket check. The newest window guarantees a fresh clear-bucket candidate is
   *  always represented in `eligible` regardless of how large the older-blocked backlog grows, at the same
   *  total worst-case row/admission-check budget as before (still `maxReleasePerSweep * 2` candidates, just
