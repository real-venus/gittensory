/** Decide whether the GitHub App auth readiness probe should be registered, and how its check() behaves, from

 *  would silently skip the probe entirely for a partial config (e.g. the App ID set but the private key unset
 *  or a load failure), letting /ready report ready anyway even though GitHub App auth cannot mint a JWT. The
 *  returned check() itself re-verifies both are present before minting, so a partial config fails closed
 *  (false) in EITHER direction — not just the one a JWT-mint helper's own internal validation happens to catch.
 *  Neither var set is the legitimate brokered-mode deployment (central Orb App, no own App credentials):
 *  correctly returns null (no probe registered, since there is nothing of this instance's own to check).
 *  Scope: a successful mint only proves the private key is present and locally well-formed (importable +
 *  signable) -- it does NOT call GitHub, so it can't catch a valid key paired with the wrong App ID, or a
 *  key GitHub has since revoked. Those still surface (via the executor's own token mint) on the next real
