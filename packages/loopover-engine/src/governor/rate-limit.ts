// jittered exponential backoff from an INJECTED random source (never Math.random) so it stays fully unit-
// testable. This module computes numbers only — it does NOT store state, schedule, or gate any write action;
// that enforcement wiring is a separate, maintainer-owned concern. The vocabulary mirrors the server-side
// `RateLimitConfig`/`RateLimitDecision` in src/auth/rate-limit.ts (that one is a Cloudflare Durable Object and
// is not reusable in the fully-local miner), but this variant is millisecond-based and state-free.
