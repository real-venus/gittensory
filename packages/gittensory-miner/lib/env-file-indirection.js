// Resolve `<NAME>_FILE` env vars (Docker/Swarm/K8s secret mounts) into `<NAME>` at miner startup (#5178).

// deployable (its own process/container per DEPLOYMENT.md's fleet mode), so it never runs through ORB's own
// server-startup resolver. Deliberately diverges from that analogue in one way: an unreadable/missing
// `<NAME>_FILE` here THROWS rather than logging and continuing, so a broken secret mount fails a miner
// container fast and loud (never silently proceeds with an unset/empty credential the next real GitHub call
// would then fail on anyway, with a far less specific error).

// Docker Compose's OWN reserved `_FILE`-suffixed environment variables -- never gittensory's secret-file
// convention, so they must never be dereferenced below (mirrors src/selfhost/load-file-secrets.ts's own
// exclusion and rationale: `COMPOSE_FILE` is a colon-delimited list of compose file paths, never a single
// readable file itself, and `COMPOSE_ENV_FILE` points at an operator's own .env file, not a secret).

/**
 * Scan `env` for `<NAME>_FILE` vars and resolve each into `<NAME>` in place, reading the referenced file's
 * contents (trimmed). An explicit `<NAME>` value always wins over `<NAME>_FILE` (mirrors the ORB analogue's
 * precedence rule exactly) -- a `_FILE` var is only consulted when its plain counterpart is unset. Throws a
 * clear, actionable error identifying the offending `<NAME>_FILE` var and its file path when the file is
 * missing or unreadable -- this never silently leaves a credential empty/undefined. Never logs or returns any
 * resolved secret value itself; only the (non-secret) var name and file path ever appear in a thrown message.
 *
 * `env` and `readFile` are injectable purely for testability -- every real caller uses the defaults
 * (`process.env`, `node:fs`'s `readFileSync`), so this is byte-identical to a hardcoded version at runtime.
 *
 * @param {Record<string, string | undefined>} [env]
 * @param {(path: string) => string} [readFile]
