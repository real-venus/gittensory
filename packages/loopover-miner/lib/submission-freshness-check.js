// Late-binding freshness check before open_pr fires (#3007). A soft-claim made at the start of a long
// create/iterate loop can go stale by the time a candidate reaches submission: the target issue may have been
// closed, already fixed by another author, or the miner's own claim may have been released/expired in the
// interim. This is a FINAL, read-only check immediately before open_pr spec construction -- complementing, not
// replacing, the claim-time check (src/miner/soft-claim.ts) -- so a stale submission never reaches the Governor
// chokepoint (governor-chokepoint.js) as a live write attempt: check freshness first, THEN prepareOpenPrSubmission
// (harness-submission-trigger.js), THEN the Governor. These are separate, sequentially-composed units, not nested
// calls -- attempt-runner.js (#2337) is the real call site that wires them together in that order.
//
// READ-ONLY BY CONTRACT: never writes anything except its own abort-reason audit event (on staleness only, not
// on every check -- mirrors this issue's own "log the abort reason" wording, not a per-decision audit trail).
// The live-state fetch is an injected dependency so this stays testable without real network I/O and agnostic
// to HOW the caller sources issue/PR state (raw GitHub API, loopover's own cached MCP data, etc.).
//
// FAIL CLOSED: an unreachable/failed live-state fetch is treated as stale (aborts), never as "no evidence of
// staleness, so proceed" -- mirrors this package's fail-closed convention elsewhere (harness-submission-
// trigger.js's predicted_gate_unavailable/slop_assessment_unavailable, iterate-loop.ts's ambiguous-on-error).
// That fail-closed OUTCOME is unchanged; a single transient blip just gets a bounded retry-with-backoff to
// resolve itself FIRST (#7089) -- the same window claim-conflict-resolver.js's resolveClaimConflict (#6058)
// already gives its own call to this identical fetchLiveIssueSnapshot, reusing http-retry.js's shared backoff.
// Aborting here discards a fully-completed create/iterate loop's local work, so riding out a brief 5xx /
// GraphQL-index propagation lag before failing closed matters more here than in the post-submission case.
//
// NOT a rejection outcome: staleness is caught BEFORE any PR exists, so it is not the same lifecycle event as
// rejection-state-machine.js's DISENGAGED_OUTCOME (which handles an EXISTING PR a maintainer closed). "No PR,
// no noisy failure" here just means: return a quiet not-fresh result, same shape as any other blocked gate
// decision in this package -- never throw, never surface anything to the target repo.
