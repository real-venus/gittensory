      <h2>The shape of a review</h2>
      <p>
        When a pull request opens or updates, <strong>gittensory CI</strong> runs a review in two
        layers and reports the result in one place:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>The gate</strong> — a deterministic pass that never asks an AI. It runs a fixed
          set of rules (duplicates, linked issues, merge-readiness, anti-slop, manifest policy) and
          each rule is <code>off</code>, <code>advisory</code>, or <code>block</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The AI review</strong> — a dual-model read of the diff that writes review notes
          and, when you opt in, lets a high-confidence <em>consensus</em> become a blocker.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        comment on the PR, plus an optional <strong>Gittensory Orb Review Agent</strong> check run.
        The review algorithm is open-source; what changes between repos is the configuration you
        tune. See <a href="/docs/tuning">Tuning your reviews</a> for the review options and
        defaults.
      </p>
      <Callout variant="safety">
        Defaults are quiet. With no settings and no <code>.gittensory.yml</code>, the gate is{" "}
        <code>off</code>, AI review is <code>off</code>, and the comment is posted only to detected
        contributors. Every capability is an explicit opt-in.
      </Callout>

      <h2>1. The gate: advisory vs. block</h2>
      <p>
        The gate is deterministic — same inputs, same verdict, no model in the loop. Its master
        switch is <code>gateCheckMode</code> (<code>off</code> / <code>enabled</code>). Once
        enabled, each <em>dimension</em> is independently set to one of three modes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>off</code> — the dimension is not evaluated at all.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>advisory</code> — the finding is <strong>surfaced</strong> in the comment, but it
          never blocks the merge.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>block</code> — the finding can become a hard{" "}
          <strong>Gittensory Orb Review Agent</strong> blocker.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A <code>block</code> outcome is always <strong>confirmed-contributor-gated</strong>: the
        mode chooses <em>which</em> checks are active, never <em>who</em> can be blocked. A genuine
        newcomer can be softened from a block to an advisory when{" "}
        <code>firstTimeContributorGrace</code> is on.
      </p>

      <h3>The gate dimensions</h3>
      <p>These are the deterministic rules the gate runs, with their default modes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Duplicate-PR gate</strong> (<code>duplicatePrGateMode</code>, default{" "}
          <code>block</code>) — detects duplicate or superseding PRs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Linked-issue gate</strong> (<code>linkedIssueGateMode</code>, default{" "}
          <code>advisory</code>) — checks the PR references an issue, as strongly as{" "}
          <code>linkedIssuePolicy</code> asks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Quality / merge-readiness score gate</strong> (<code>qualityGateMode</code>,
          default <code>advisory</code>) — the PR-quality score; passes at or above{" "}
          <code>qualityGateMinScore</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Slop gate</strong> (<code>slopGateMode</code>, default <code>off</code>) — the
          deterministic anti-slop signal. <code>advisory</code> surfaces the slop score and
          warnings; <code>block</code> also hard-blocks at or above <code>slopGateMinScore</code>{" "}
          (engine default band <code>60</code>).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Merge-readiness gate</strong> (<code>mergeReadinessGateMode</code>, default{" "}
          <code>off</code>) — a composite readiness check.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Manifest-policy gate</strong> (<code>manifestPolicyGateMode</code>, default{" "}
          <code>off</code>) — when <code>block</code>, the repo's declared policy (required linked
          issue and test expectations) becomes enforceable. Manual-review path holds are controlled
          separately by <code>settings.hardGuardrailGlobs</code>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Which deterministic rules even apply is set by the <strong>policy pack</strong> (
        <code>gatePack</code>): <code>gittensor</code> (confirmed-contributor-gated, registry-aware)
        or <code>oss-anti-slop</code> (runs the rules against any author on any repo).
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        filename=".gittensory.yml"
        code={`gate:
  enabled: true
  pack: gittensor
  duplicates: block
  linkedIssue: advisory
  readiness:
    mode: advisory
    minScore: 70
  slop:
    mode: block
    minScore: 60
  mergeReadiness: advisory
  manifestPolicy: block
  firstTimeContributorGrace: true`}
      />

      <h2>2. The dual-AI review and consensus</h2>
      <p>
        AI review is its own dimension (<code>aiReviewMode</code>, default <code>off</code>). It
        reads the diff and produces review notes — concrete findings tied to the change, not a vague
        verdict. Two modes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>advisory</code> — the AI write-up is posted as notes only. It never blocks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>block</code> — a <strong>dual-model high-confidence consensus</strong> defect is
          allowed to become a blocker (confirmed contributors only).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The blocking decision always runs on a <strong>pair</strong> of free models and only blocks
        when <em>both</em> models independently agree, with high confidence, on a real defect. Two
        agreeing models is the bar — there is no single-model block and no tie-breaker third model.
        That consensus requirement is what keeps a confident-but-wrong single model from blocking a
        good PR.
      </p>

      <h3>Bring your own model (advisory only)</h3>
      <p>
        With <code>aiReviewByok: true</code> and a configured provider key, the <em>advisory</em>{" "}
        write-up can use a maintainer's own frontier model (<code>aiReviewProvider</code> /{" "}
        <code>aiReviewModel</code>, e.g. <code>claude-3-5-sonnet-latest</code>). The consensus
        blocker always stays on the free model pair, so BYOK improves the prose without ever
        changing <em>who</em> can be blocked.
      </p>
      <Callout variant="note" title="Grounding makes the AI check reality">
        The <code>GITTENSORY_REVIEW_GROUNDING</code> flag grounds the reviewer prompt with the PR's
        finished CI status and the full post-change content of the changed files — so the model
        verifies its claims instead of predicting CI or flagging a symbol defined just outside the
        diff hunk. <code>GITTENSORY_REVIEW_RAG</code> adds semantically related existing code and
        docs as extra context. Both are additive and opt-in.
      </Callout>

      <h2>3. The unified review comment</h2>
      <p>
        The result is rendered as <strong>one in-place comment</strong> on the PR — updated in place
        on each push rather than stacked — when <code>GITTENSORY_REVIEW_UNIFIED_COMMENT</code> is on
        for the repo. It has three parts, top to bottom:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>The alert</strong> — a one-line headline verdict: whether the gate blocks, what
          the single most important blocker is, or that the PR is clear. This is the line a reader
          scans first.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The signal table</strong> — a compact row-per-signal summary: each dimension that
          ran, its state (pass / advisory / block), and a short reason. This is the at-a-glance map
          of why the verdict came out the way it did.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Collapsibles</strong> — expandable sections for the detail behind each signal: the
          AI review notes, the slop warnings, duplicate matches, manifest findings. Folded away by
          default so the comment stays short, opened when a reader wants the evidence.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Who sees the comment, and how much detail it carries, is a repo setting:{" "}
        <code>commentMode</code> chooses the audience (<code>off</code> /{" "}
        <code>detected_contributors_only</code> / <code>all_prs</code>), and{" "}
        <code>publicSignalLevel</code> (<code>minimal</code> / <code>standard</code>) controls how
        much of the signal detail is published. Private review context (<code>maintainerNotes</code>
        ) is never published to a public surface.
      </p>
      <Callout variant="safety">
        Public-facing comments are sanitized before they leave the worker. Private scoring, reward,
        and reputation language never appears in the PR thread — and reputation-based spend control
        (<code>GITTENSORY_REVIEW_REPUTATION</code>) is never surfaced in any comment, label, or
        check.
      </Callout>

      <h2>4. The signals behind a verdict</h2>
      <p>Each row in the signal table comes from a named finding. The common ones you will see:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>secret_leak</code> — the safety scan (<code>GITTENSORY_REVIEW_SAFETY</code>) found a
          leaked secret in the diff. The same scan also defangs untrusted PR text before the AI
          reviewer reads it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>guardrail_hold</code> — the PR touches a path listed in{" "}
          <code>settings.hardGuardrailGlobs</code>. This is a manual-review hold, not an auto-close
          reason.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>manifest_missing_tests</code> — code changed but the expected test paths (
          <code>testExpectations</code>) did not.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Slop score + warnings</strong> — the deterministic anti-slop signal. With{" "}
          <code>slopAiAdvisory: true</code>, a free advisory-only <code>ai_slop_advisory</code>{" "}
          finding is added too — it never feeds the score or the gate.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Duplicate match</strong> — the other PR this one duplicates or supersedes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>AI review notes</strong> — the dual-model findings, and (in <code>block</code>{" "}
          mode) any consensus defect.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The check run can carry the same signals at adjustable depth: <code>checkRunMode</code> (
        <code>off</code> / <code>enabled</code>) publishes the{" "}
        <strong>Gittensory Orb Review Agent</strong> check, and <code>checkRunDetailLevel</code> (
        <code>minimal</code> / <code>standard</code> / <code>deep</code>) sets how much the check
        summary spells out.
      </p>

      <h2>Putting it together</h2>
      <p>
        A pull request flows through the deterministic gate, then the dual-AI review, and the union
        of both is rendered as one alert + signal table + collapsibles comment. The gate decides{" "}
        <em>can this merge</em> with fixed rules you can read; the AI review adds judgment as
        advisory notes, escalating to a blocker only on two-model consensus; and the comment is the
        single, sanitized place a contributor reads the whole verdict. Tune every mode, threshold,
        and surface in <a href="/docs/tuning">Tuning your reviews</a>.
