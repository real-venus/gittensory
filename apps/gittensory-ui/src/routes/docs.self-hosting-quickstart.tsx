      <h2>1. Copy the sample env</h2>
      <p>
        The sample env contains placeholders only. Keep your real <code>.env</code> out of git and
        prefer mounted secret files for multiline values like the GitHub App private key.
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        lang="bash"
        code={`cp .env.example .env
# edit .env`}
      />

      <h2>2. Start conservative</h2>
      <p>
        Begin with a small allowlist, unified comments, safety, and grounding. Leave AI, RAG, and
        REES off until webhook delivery and deterministic review are working.
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        filename=".env"

      <CodeBlock

            title: "/metrics",
            description: "Prometheus metrics for queue, jobs, HTTP traffic, uptime, and AI usage.",
          },
        ]}
      />

      <h2>4. Install or connect the GitHub App</h2>
      <p>
        Point your App webhook to <code>https://your-host.example/v1/github/webhook</code>, set the
        same webhook secret in <code>GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET</code>, install the App on one test repo,
        and open a small PR. The direct App and Orb modes are covered in{" "}
        <Link to="/docs/self-hosting-github-app">GitHub App and Orb</Link>.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Watch the first review</h2>
      <p>Look for these logs during boot and the first webhook:</p>
      <CodeBlock
        code={`selfhost_listening
selfhost_migrations_applied
selfhost_ai_provider          # only when AI_PROVIDER is set
selfhost_job_dead             # investigate immediately if present
review_context_fetch_failed   # REES/RAG/grounding context failure`}
      />
      <p>
        After the deterministic path is stable, continue with{" "}
        <Link to="/docs/self-hosting-configuration">Configuration</Link> and then layer in AI, REES,
        or RAG deliberately.
      </p>
