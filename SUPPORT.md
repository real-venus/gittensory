# Support

Use GitHub issues for public, non-sensitive support:

- frontend route, hydration, signed-out/signed-in app, or API Try It problems
- MCP install, auth, or local branch-analysis problems
- GitHub App install health, permissions, or comment/label behavior
- API contract, data freshness, or signal-quality bugs
- Cloudflare Worker deploy/runtime behavior
- documentation gaps

Do not post secrets, private keys, webhook payload secrets, wallet details, hotkeys, coldkeys,
raw session tokens, private maintainer evidence, or private scoring output in public issues.

For security issues, use the guidance in `SECURITY.md`.

For conduct issues, use the expectations in `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.

## Useful Issue Details

- LoopOver MCP version from `loopover-mcp status`
- command used, with tokens and local paths removed
- sanitized error message
- repository owner/name when relevant
- frontend route or API endpoint when relevant
- whether the problem is UI, MCP, API, GitHub App, Cloudflare deploy/runtime, docs, or data freshness

## Expected Response Posture

LoopOver is maintained as a Cloudflare Worker, frontend, GitHub App, and agent-integration
project. Support should keep the same boundaries as the product: no public wallet data, no raw
trust scores, no public reward estimates, and no source-code upload by default.
